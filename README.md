# 🚀 CargoBridge Connectors

Welcome to the **CargoBridge Connectors** repository — the community hub for integrations that connect CargoBridge to external systems.

This repo hosts **community-built connectors** for ERP, CRM, fleet management, eFTI pilots, and more.

----------

## 🌐 What’s Inside

Each connector is a standalone integration that lets CargoBridge communicate with external platforms, including:

-   **ERP systems** (SAP, Oracle, MS Dynamics, etc.)
    
-   **CRM platforms** (Odoo, Twenty CRM, etc.)
    
-   **Fleet management & telematics** (Traccar, OpenRemote, etc.)
    
-   **eFTI pilots and compliance tools**
    
-   Any other logistics or enterprise software
